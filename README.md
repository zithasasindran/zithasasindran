## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Zitha Sasindran, a dedicated researcher specializing in developing practical and scalable machine learning systems for IoT embedded devices. I have completed my Ph.D. at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, in the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering. My research focuses on edge-based machine intelligence, with a proven track record of advancing this field through impactful publications and collaborative multi-disciplinary projects.

I have contributed to various projects, including the development of resource-efficient federated learning frameworks, automatic speech recognition solutions for resource-constrained devices, and real-time systems for traffic surveillance etc.

Feel free to explore my repositories to learn more about my research (though not all of my work is publicly available!) and contributions to the field.
